### Tables

#### Traits

Here are some key tables and fields that we will look at:


| Column       | References    | Comments                                                                                        |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id           |               |                                                                                                 |
| site_id      | sites.id      | Site at which measurement was taken.                                                            |
| specie_id    | species.id    | Species on which measurement was taken.                                                         |
| citation_id  | citations.id  | Citation in which data was originally reported.                                                 |
| cultivar_id  | cultivars.id  | Cultivar information, if any.                                                                   |
| treatment_id | treatments.id | Experimental treatment identification. Required, can indicate observational study.              |
| date         |               | Date on which measurement was made.                                                             |
| time         |               | Time at which measurement was taken. Sometimes necessary, e.g. for photosynthesis measurements. |
| mean         |               | Mean value of trait.                       



#### Treatments



| Column       | References    | Comments                                                                                        |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| id           |               ||
| name      | sites.id      | Name of treatment, should be easy to associate with treatment name in original study..|
| definition    | species.id    | 	Description of treatment, e.g. levels of fertilizer applied, etc. This information may be redundant with 'levels' information recorded in Managements table..|
| control  | citations.id  |Boolean, indicates if treatment is a control or observational (1) or experimental treatment (0).|


#### Managements


| Column      | References   | Comments                                      |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|

| citation_id | citations.id |                                               |
| date        |              | Date on which management was conducted.       |
| mgmttype    |              | Type of management                            |
| level       |              | Amount applied, not always required.          |
| units       |              | units, standardized for each management type. |


#### Managements-Treatments

| Column        | References     |
|---------------|----------------|
| treatment_id  | treatments.id  |
| management_id | managements.id |


```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(traits)
year = lubridate::year

# TODO: Maybe just leave this as a list in user environment and pass it explicitly
# Need to update traits pkg so this works

options(bety_auth = list(
  url="https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/",
  key="9999999999999999999999999999999999999999",
  api_version="beta"))

## query and join tables
species <- (betydb_query(table="species", limit="none")
  %>% select(specie_id = id, scientificname, genus))

# Regex is to convert geometry column to lat/long --
# starts out as e.g. "POINT(40.11, -88.22, 223)"


sites <- betydb_query(table="sites") %>% 
  extract(
    col = geometry,
    into = c("lat", "lon", "ele"),
    regex = "POINT \\(([-.\\d]+) ([-.\\d]+) ([-.\\d]+)\\)",
    convert=TRUE)
    
  sites %>% select(site_id = id, lat, lon, sitename, city, country)


citations <- (betydb_query(table="citations")
  %>% select(citation_id = id, author, year, title))

# Fails because terraref BETY's yields table is empty
# Succeeds if betyurl="https://www.betydb.org/" (with a valid key...)
yields = (betydb_query(table="yields")
  %>% select(
    id, date, mean,
    n, statname, stat,
    site_id, specie_id, treatment_id,
    citation_id, cultivar_id)
  %>% left_join(species, by = 'specie_id')
  %>% left_join(sites, by = 'site_id')
    %>% left_join(citations, by = 'citation_id'))

```

Let's do the manual equivalent of a cross-table join. BETY actually does contain a `managements_treatments` view that would make this faster and easier, but it is not (yet) exposed via API, so let's use it as an example of how to create your own join.

The key idea here is that each treatment is associated with some (possibly many) managements, but the treatments table only reports the number of associated managements. To see the management IDs themselves, we need to query an individual treatment ID. So, we retrieve one table, then iterate over each row extracting the foreign keys for the other table. This requires an API call for every treatment, so beware that it is likely to be slow!

```r
treatments <- (betydb_query(table = 'treatments')
  %>% select(treatment_id = id , name, definition, control))

get_mgid <- function(trtid){
  betydb_item(id=trtid, table="treatments")$managements$management.id
}

managements_treatments <- (treatments 
  %>% group_by(treatment_id)
  %>% do(management_id = get_mgid(.$treatment_id))
  %>% unnest())

managements <- (betydb_query(table = 'managements')
  %>% filter(mgmttype %in% c('fertilizer_N', 'fertilizer_N_rate', 'planting', 'irrigation'))
  %>% select(management_id = id, date, mgmttype, level, units)
  %>% left_join(managements_treatments, by = 'management_id')
  %>% left_join(treatments, by = 'treatment_id'))

planting <- (managements
  %>% filter(mgmttype == "planting")
  %>% select(treatment_id, planting_date = date, nrate = level))

grass_yields <- (yields
  %>% filter(genus %in% c('Miscanthus', 'Panicum'))
  %>% left_join(planting, by = 'treatment_id')
  %>% collect
  %>% replace_na(replace=list(nrate = 0))
  %>% mutate(
    age = year(date) - year(planting_date),
    SE = case_when(
      .$statname == "SE" ~ .$stat,
      .$statname == 'SD' ~ .$stat / sqrt(.$n),
      TRUE ~ NA_real_),
    continent = case_when(
      .$lon < -30 ~ "united_states",
      .$lon < 75 ~ "europe",
      TRUE ~ "asia"))
    %>% filter(!duplicated(.)))

ggplot(data = grass_yields, aes(lon,lat)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = genus, size = mean), 
             alpha = 0.1)
```
